            <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
            <p>As mentioned on my resume, I have a high level understanding in many languages, including: C++, JS (and Typecript), HTML/CSS, and Python</p>
            <p>I am also proficient in languages such as GO, mySQL, and Java, but not to the same extent as the above languages.</p>
            <p>I have also spent the past 3 years learning Japanese at my university!</p>
            <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>AI: Obviously, AI is a huge craze right now, especially because of the advent of language models like <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>. To me, AI is interesting because it goes back to the question "What makes us humans so unique?" Being able to work on something like an AGI would be a dream for me, but even AIs like Chess AIs (<a href="https://stockfishchess.org/" target="_blank">like Stockfish</a>) are interesting because they show us computers that are able to think in ways humans could not even imagine.</p></li>
                <li><p>ML: I am interested in ML not only because of it's applications in AI, but because the process of a computer self-learning to me is incredibly intriguing for reasons previously mentioned.</p></li>
                <li><p>Data Science: Different from the above two, I have always been really interested in the types of conclusions one can make from large datasets. These can be important for something like figuring out voting trends of the populace, or finding out what the controlling variable might be in an incredibly complicated problem. Good data analysis can come up with conclusions that can drastically improve the lives of everyone on the planet.</p></li>
